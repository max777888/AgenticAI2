--- > gcloud auth application-default login

This command will open a browser window and prompt you to log in to your Google account. It will then generate a local credentials file (application_default_credentials.json) that ADK can find automatically

The gcloud command creates a credentials file and stores it in a well-known location on your system (e.g., %APPDATA%\gcloud on Windows).
When your ADK application starts and sees GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=1 in your .env file, it looks for ADC credentials.
The Google authentication libraries find the credentials file that gcloud created and use it to get a temporary access token for your specified project.
Your application is now successfully authenticated and can communicate with the Vertex AI API in your GCP project
